# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE tag controls the color of the HTML output.
# Doxygen will adjust the colors in the stylesheet and background images
# according to this color. Hue is specified as an angle on a colorwheel,
# see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue for more information.
# For instance the value 0 represents red, 60 is yellow, 120 is green,
# 180 is cyan, 240 is blue, 300 purple, and 360 is red again.
# The allowed range is 0 to 359.

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT tag controls the purity (or saturation) of
# the colors in the HTML output. For a value of 0 the output will use
# grayscales only. A value of 255 will produce the most vivid colors.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT    = 100

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA tag controls the gamma correction applied to
# the luminance component of the colors in the HTML output. Values below
# 100 gradually make the output lighter, whereas values above 100 make
# the output darker. The value divided by 100 is the actual gamma applied,
# so 80 represents a gamma of 0.8, The value 220 represents a gamma of 2.2,
# and 100 does not change the gamma.
